# DESCRIPTION:
This project is a simulated chatbot that mimics human-like interactions in real-time using modern web technologies. Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Socket.io for seamless communication between the user and the server. The application provides an intuitive chat interface and responds to user inputs instantly, creating the feel of chatting with a person.Powered by Socket.io, the backend in server.js processes user inputs and sends predefined replies or fallback responses, simulating a natural conversation. The bot's polite and conversational tone, coupled with its ability to acknowledge unrecognized inputs, creates a human-like experience. The design is simple and intuitive, resembling modern messaging apps, making it engaging and user-friendly while demonstrating the power of real-time communication.
